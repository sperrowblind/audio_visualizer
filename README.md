# audio_visualizer

The goal for this project is to create an audio editor in order to manipulate
and visualize music from different audio files/formats

Currently, is functionality for wav files, but I plan on adding support for mp3
and possibly flac audio files.

Current functionality:
Play song entered into application,
Reverse and output song

Future functionality:
Clean up project,
Trim leading and trailing custom seconds from file
mp3 support
flac support
Change bitrate
make 8-bit
Basic remove lyrics
visualize data in waveform
possibly stream waveform audio visualizer when song plays
