# audio_visualizer

The goal for this project is to create an audio editor in order to manipulate
and visualize music from different audio files/formats

Currently, is functionality for wav files, but I plan on adding support for mp3
and possibly flac audio files.

Current functionality:
Play song entered into application,
Reverse song,
Trim leading or trailing seconds from song,
Make song 8-bit (partial functionality),
Normalize volume,
Apply dither,
Output song

Future functionality:
Clean up project,
mp3 support
flac support
slow or speed up file
Basic remove lyrics
visualize data in waveform
possibly stream waveform audio visualizer when song plays
